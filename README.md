### **1️⃣ Understanding the Game Logic**  
Tic-Tac-Toe is a **turn-based** game played on a **3x3 grid**.  
- The **player** and the **computer** take turns placing their marks (`X` or `O`).  
- The first to get **three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins**.  
- If all **nine spaces** are filled without a winner, it's a **draw**.  

---

### **2️⃣ How the Code Works**  
The `tic_tac_toe.py` script contains:  

🔹 A **game board** stored as a **list of 9 elements** (`0-8` as positions).  
🔹 **Functions** to:
   - Display the board  
   - Take user input & validate moves  
   - Let the computer make a random valid move  
   - Check for a **winner or a draw**
